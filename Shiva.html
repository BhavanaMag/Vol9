<h4> The Dance of Shiva -- Patachitra with Tibetan Thangka influences</h4> <br>

<p>
The dance of Shiva has been immortalized in Indian paintings and sculptures from time immemorial.
In this pencil sketch, adapted from a South Indian temple sculpture, the posture of the deity is remarkable;
To this, a setting has been added, to reflect his abode in Kailash, where he has some followers.
Beside the heavenly abode, quietly flows the Ganga and hills and ravines reverberate with the sound of his domoru.
The lesser evils run away as he transcends into the Nataraja form -- immortal bliss reigns supreme.
