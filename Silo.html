<h4> Granaries of Buffalo, NY</h4> <br>

<p>
Buffalo's grain elevators are a notable part of the city's history and architecture.
They symbolize the city's history, labor, immigration, industrial past, and urban development.   
One can explore the granaries by taking a walk in Silo City, kayaking along elevator alley, or 
touring with the Buffalo River History boat tours.
