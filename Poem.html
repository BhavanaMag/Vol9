<h4>Clean</h4> <br>
======================== <br>
by Karubaki Goswami <br><br>

She drowns in the sea, <br>
In its hypnotic blue, <br>
That cradled her with love,<br>
More than the air could ever give her,<br>
When she was with the gale.<br><br>

The water runs its fingers over her skin,<br>
Like a lover’s touch,<br>
Cleansing her like a poignant poem,<br>
That soothes the tortured soul, but never lifts the cost.<br>
Yet she screams, silently,<br>
Feeling kisses like bullets on her skin,<br>
She misses the air —<br>
The dark, cancerous gas that poisoned her lungs, <br>
Turning her into a dead dove.<br>
And she ran to the water.<br><br>

The sea fills her lungs,<br>
She screams so loud, but no one hears a thing.<br>
She sobs, but what is a tear,<br>
But one of the thousands in the sea?<br>
She cries, and the sea stays still,<br>
For what is a tear but a part of him?<br>
And she's clean, turning black and blue in the sea,<br>
Wanting her color back,<br>
Even if it’s from the air that wasted her.<br><br>
