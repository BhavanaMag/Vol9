A short review of Dune by Frank Herbert. <br>

<p>
  Dune is a science fiction novel by Frank Herbert taking place in an interstellar society. 
  The setting is similar in some ways to Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series
  in having a Galactic Empire, but it is much more feudal. There is a Padishah Emperor
  (Shaddam IV at the time of the story), and all the fiefs are controlled by Great Houses. 
  There is still a very prevalent fictitious aspect in the book, with technologies like
  advanced space travel, shields that prevent the user from being attacked, and lasguns 
  that cut through anything.

The story begins with our main character, Paul Atredies, of House Atreides, 
  son of Duke Leto and Lady Jessica. The Emperor directs the House to go to Arrakis, 
  the Dune planet, moving from their ocean homeworld of Caladan. However, the Emperor 
  dislikes Duke Leto’s growing popularity with the Landsraad (Council of Great Houses) 
  and conspires with the Harkonnens, the House Atreides’ long enemy to destroy them. 
  Lady Jessica, a Bene Gesserit (a female group aiming to pursue strange political 
  aims and superhuman powers), was ordered to bear Duke Leto a daughter, in hope of 
  creating the Kwisatz Hadderach, or a male messiah formed at the end of a long 
  selective breeding program. However, Jessica chooses to have a son instead, Paul. 
  Paul is trained in many forms of combat from the Duke’s men, and then the orders 
  to move to Arrakis arrive. On Arrakis, Paul will have to face more than he ever thought, 
  mastering desert power and meeting Arrakis’s inhabitants while overcoming the 
  Harkonnens… all with the possibility of war.

  Dune is a personal favorite of mine and I plan to read the continuations 
  of the book by Frank Herbert, and is undoubtedly a great science fiction novel. 
  It has many recurring ideas, weaving politics and religion into the storyline, 
  while action remains prevalent. There are many twists throughout the story that 
  are definitely unexpected, and each chapter is interestingly told with thoughts 
  from the character featured, leaving the reader to understand their motivations 
  and actions. Dune is a great read for understanding politics and religion, 
  while also incorporating many futuristic technologies into writing. He also 
  shows how humanity has also somewhat regressed in this feudal time by depicting 
  gladiator fights and other things that would usually be considered barbaric and most unusual.

  Overall, Dune is a great read for any science fiction lovers and those 
  interested in a compelling storyline that is really hard to predict and fun as a result. 
  It is also interesting for readers who like empire novels and how they rise and fall. 
  See you on Arrakis!
